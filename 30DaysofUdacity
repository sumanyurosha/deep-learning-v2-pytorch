  2. Implemented model validation for MNIST dataset classification.

Day 2:
22/10/2019
  1. Watching the next videos of CNNs.
  2. Knowing about edges & filters and how CNNs try to identify them from an image using the frequency changes.

Day 3:
23/10/2019
  1. Learned about Convolutional and Pooling layers today.
  2. Got to know more about visualisation of convolution layers through this blog: http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/
 
Day 4:
24/10/2019
  1. Applied Convolution and Max Pooling to images.

Day 5:
25/10/2019
  1. Working on CIFAR-10 dataset and was able to achieve an Accuracy of 70%.
  2. Saw a [tutorial](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/beginner_source/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.py) on CIFAR Classification problem 
  3. Reading a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf) on CNN
