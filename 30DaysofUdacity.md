  ## Day 12:
  02/11/2019
   * Started working on Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier. 
   
  ## Day 13:
  03/11/2019
   * Working on Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier.
   * Done till Question number 4.
   * Used a VGG16 model for detecting dog vs human.
   * Creating a CNN from scratch to classify dog breeds.
   
  ## Day 14:
  04/11/2019
   * Training my scratch model for 100 epochs to get a decent accuracy.
   * Had a 1:1 with my mentor today. 
   
  ## Day 15:
  05/11/2019
   * Finally I was able to get more than 10% accuracy for my scratch model.
   * Now using Resnet18 for Transfer Learning and training it's classifier.
   * Aiming to submit my project tonight!
 ## Day 16:
 06/11/2019

  * Still working on Project 2: Dog breed classification.
  * Stuck in model selection for transfer learning since Resnet18 and vgg16 are not giving good results.
  * Trying some hyper parameter tuning.
  
 ## Day 17:
